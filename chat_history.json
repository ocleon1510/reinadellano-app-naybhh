understand the current components and styles.\n    *   Implement the basic layout and navigation using the existing `_layout.tsx` file.\n    *   Create a new file `constants/colors.ts` to define the color scheme based on the logo (yellow, green, brown, black, white).\n    *   Modify `styles/commonStyles.ts` to incorporate the new color scheme.\n\n2.  **Implement Core Features:**\n    *   Create the main screens:\n        *   Home screen (displaying the main banner image and product categories).\n        *   Product listing screen (displaying products within a category).\n        *   Product detail screen (displaying product information).\n        *   Shopping cart screen (allowing users to manage their order).\n        *   User registration/login screens.\n    *   Implement the shopping cart functionality.\n    *   Implement the WhatsApp sharing functionality.\n\n3.  **Implement Admin Area:**\n    *   Create the admin login screen.\n    *   Create the admin dashboard.\n    *   Implement the product and category management features.\n    *   Implement the admin user management features.\n\n4.  **Implement the UI/UX:**\n    *   Incorporate farm and countryside visuals into the background and decorative elements.\n    *   Ensure interactive navigation with smooth transitions.\n    *   Implement responsive layouts for phones and tablets.\n\n5.  **Implement the Database:**\n    *   Since the user requested backend functionality, instruct the user to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button, and connecting to a project (they might need to create one in Supabase first).\n\n6.  **Implement the Authentication:**\n    *   Since the user requested backend functionality, instruct the user to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button, and connecting to a project (they might need to create one in Supabase first).\n\n7.  **Finalize and Deliver:**\n    *   Write well-documented source code.\n    *   Provide instructions to build, install, and deploy
